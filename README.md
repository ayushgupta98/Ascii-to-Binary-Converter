# verilog

All programs listed here are tested on Model Sim and Xilinx ISE-14.7.

To synthesize the module follow the following steps:
1. Comment out all the $display statements as they are unsynthesizable.
2. Comment out the Testbench if present in the main code.
3. Fork/join statements are also unsynthesizable so comment them out.
